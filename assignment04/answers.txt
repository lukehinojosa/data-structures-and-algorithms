1. Bubble sort is worse than selection and insertion sort because of it's higher number of swaps and comparisons.

2. An optimized insertion sort is faster than selection sort because selection sort is always going to take O(n^2), whereas an optimized insertion sort makes fewer comparisons.

3. The class would need operator overloads to compare the values to be compared in order to sort it.

4. std::sort using faster algorithms that run at O(n log n) and switches between the algorithms for speed. std::sort also accesses the cache on the computer to access data faster.
