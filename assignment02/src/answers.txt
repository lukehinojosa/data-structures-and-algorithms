The tightest bound Big O for randomIntArray() is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

The tightest bound Big O for arraySearchSpeed() is O(numTests * length).
The total runtime is determined by the sum of the complexities of the operations within the function. The dominant growth factors are the loops that perform the searches.
Linear Search Tests: The linear search has a complexity of O(length) and is performed numTests times, resulting in O(numTests * length).
Binary Search Tests: The binary search has a complexity of O(log length) and is performed numTests times, resulting in O(numTests * log length).
The term that grows the fastest is O(numTests * length) from the linear search loop, which therefore dominates the overall runtime.
If numTests and length are the same input size n, this can be expressed as O(n^2).

Cost of one linear search = N * 5
                          = 10,000 * 5
                          = 50,000

Cost of X linear searches - X * 50,000

Cost of one-time sorting = 12 * N * log_base2(N)
                         = 12 * 10,000 * log_base2(10,000)
                         = About 1,594,525.49, so I'll say 1,594,526

Cost of one binary search = log_base2(N)
                          = log_base2(10,000)
                          = About 13.29, so I'll say 14

14 comparisons * 10 instructions/comparison = 140 instructions

Total cost for sorting and searching = X * 140 + 1,594,526

    X * 50,000 = X * 140 + 1,594,526
50,000X - 140X = 1,594,526
       49,860X = 1,594,526
             X = About 32

At 32 searches, the costs between the two are equal.

I would need to do 33 searches to make soring the array and using
binary search a more efficient method than linear search.

A struct: A struct can be defined to hold the two return values.
std::tuple: An std::tuple can be used to return multiple values. Kind of like std::pair, but with more values
std::array: An std::array<long, 2> can be used to return a fixed-size array containing the two time values.
