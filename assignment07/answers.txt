1. Queue examples:
   People wait in a queue to get on a ride for an amusement park ride.
   A factory production line for the construction of a product.
   Many games use input buffering to let the player input multiple times in a frame, and the queue retains the order.

2. Stack examples:
   A stack of paper.
   The undo history in an editor.
   Backtracking in general.

3. No. Unit tests only check for issues that developers anticipated and wrote tests for. They can fail to account for
real user situations.

4. Linked lists are better than fixed-size arrays for implementing stacks and queues because they are able to be
dynamically resized. Linked lists are also O(1) to add and remove to the head or tail. A pop for a queue with a
fixed-array would be O(n) since it would need to shift everything to the left.
