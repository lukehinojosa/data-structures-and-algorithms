1. Instead of choosing the edge with the minimum weight to connect a vertex in the spanning tree to a vertex outside the
   tree, you select the edge with the maximum weight to create a maximum spanning tree.

2. A minimum-spanning-tree finds the cheapest way to connect all vertices in a graph, whereas a solution to the
   Traveling Salesman problem finds the shortest possible path that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the
   starting point.

4. With a priority queue: The time complexity is O(E log V).
   Without a priority queue: The time complexity is O(V^2).

5. It always selects the lowest-weight edge.

   The RSA algorithm, used for secure data transmission, was first invented by Clifford Cocks in 1973.
   He did not receive credit because his work for the British intelligence agency GCHQ was classified as top secret and
   hidden from the public.
